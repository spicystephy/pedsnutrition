      <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        Our goal at Peds Nutrition, LLC is to help you turn nutrition
        recommendations into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We practice Ellyn Satter’s “Division of Responsibility.” At the most
        basic level this means that caregivers are responsible for the when,
        where, and what of a feeding and children are responsible for the how
        much (if any). We focus on personalized nutrition for your child(ren)
        and family. Whether you are struggling with a picky eater, not sure
        when/how to start solids with your infant, have a child with food
        allergies, are concerned about your child’s growth, have a child with
        abnormal nutrition related lab values, have a child with GI issues, or
        just want to change the eating habits of your child, we want to help. We
        will take the time to assess the situation, determine where you and the
        best plan for making changes, and go with you on this journey. We are
        committed to you and your child’s success.

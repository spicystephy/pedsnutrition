      <h2>Why see a dietitian?</h2>
      <p>
        Dietitians are the experts in nutrition. They have a minimum or a
        bachelor’s degree in nutrition, a 1200 hours hands on internship, must
        pass a national credentialing exam, and meet continuing education
        requirements. You see a doctor for your child’s medical needs, and a
        dentist for your child’s dental needs. It only makes sense to see a
        dietitian for your child’s nutrition needs.

      <p>
      A quick internet search will show you that there is plenty of  nutrition information available to you.  This can be confusing and potentially dangerous. We will help you understand nutrition recommendations and guide you in making them work for your family. We are not interested in telling you what or how to feed your child(ren). We want to work with you to figure out what works best for your family.

      <h2>Will an appointment be covered by my insurance?</h2>
      <p>
      At this time insurance is not accepted by Peds Nutrition, LLC. All appointments will be paid by the individual with payment due at the time of the appointment. Contact your insurance provider to see if they will reimburse you for seeing an out of network provider.

      <h2>Are all appointments virtual?</h2>
      <p>
      Yes. At this time, all appointments will be completed virtually.
